1. Redis v.s. Memcached
Memcached is designed for simplicity while Redis offers a rich set of features that make it effective for a wide range of use cases.

n addition to strings, Redis supports lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bit arrays, and hyperloglogs.

With Redis you can keep your data on disk with a point in time snapshot which can be used for archiving or recovery.

Redis lets you create multiple replicas of a Redis primary. This allows you to scale database reads and to have highly available clusters.

Redis supports **transactions** which let you execute a group of commands as an isolated and atomic operation.
